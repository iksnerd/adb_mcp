# Tool reference

← Back to the [README](../README.md)

Every device-facing tool takes an optional `serial` (adb `-s`). Omit it when a
single device is attached; with several, pass one from `list_devices`.

### Emulator / device management
| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `list_avds` | List AVDs available to boot |
| `boot_emulator` | Boot an AVD (detached), wait for boot, return its serial |
| `list_devices` | List attached devices and adb state |
| `wait_for_boot` | Block until `sys.boot_completed=1` |
| `shutdown_emulator` | Power off (`adb emu kill`) |
| `connect_wireless` | Connect/pair a device over Wi-Fi (`adb connect`/`pair`) |
| `adb_reverse` | Forward a device port to a host port (`adb reverse`) — required for RN/Expo dev clients to reach Metro (else they silently run the embedded bundle) |

### Observe
| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `screenshot` | Capture the screen as a PNG (auto-downscaled) — to *see* state; retries an all-black frame and flags why (FLAG_SECURE / screen off); works on multi-display foldables (`display: "cover"`/`"inner"`/index picks a panel) |
| `describe_ui` | UI hierarchy as elements with text/desc/id + true-pixel `center` — to *aim*. Header reports the focused `top window` (spot system-overlay occlusion) + hidden-node count; `filter` (`auto`/`clickable`/`all` — `all` proves absence), `query` ("is X on screen?"), `compact` (~10x smaller) |

### Interact
| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tap` | Tap true-pixel `(x,y)` (use a `describe_ui` center); `verify_change` reports `ui_changed`, `identify` reports which element the coordinate hit (or that it hit a non-clickable wrapper / no reported element) |
| `tap_on_text` | Find an element by label/desc and tap its center; `verify_change` reports `ui_changed` |
| `tap_element` | Find an element by resource_id (filter=all, so unlabeled wrappers count) and tap its center, re-resolving right before tapping; `verify_change` reports `ui_changed` |
| `long_press` | Press and hold `(x,y)` for a duration |
| `wait_for_text` | Poll until a label appears, then return its tappable center |
| `wait` | Plain sleep (seconds) — for time-based conditions (background-timer flows, cooldowns) |
| `run_sequence` | Run several steps in ONE call (sleep/tap/tap_text/tap_element/key/text/swipe/launch/stop/wait_text/describe_ui) with `if_present`/`if_absent` guards — no round-trip between steps, so native-timer flows aren't perturbed; returns per-step results + the final hierarchy |
| `swipe` | Swipe/drag (scroll down = high y → low y); `x`/`y` alias `x1`/`y1` |
| `drag` | Press-hold-move-release drag (`draganddrop`) — for drag handles & reorder |
| `input_text` | Type into the focused field via the IME |
| `press_key` | Press a named key (`enter`,`back`,`home`,`escape`,`wakeup`,`sleep`,…) or raw keycode; `verify_change` reports `ui_changed` (a key can be silently consumed by an overlay) |
| `input_key_combo` | Press a chord together — `keys=["ctrl","a"]` or `preset="select_all"`/`copy`/`paste`/… |
| `enter_pin` | Enter digits on a PIN pad — with `grid`/`coords` for canvas-drawn pads |

### Device lock / Keystore
| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `set_device_lock` | Set a pin/pattern/password (needed for Keystore-backed crypto) |
| `clear_device_lock` | Remove the lock (supply the current credential) |
| `is_device_secure` | Whether a secure lock is set |
| `fingerprint_touch` | Simulate a fingerprint touch (emulator-only, `adb emu finger touch`) — satisfy a BiometricPrompt instead of cancelling to the PIN fallback |
| `finger_remove` | Lift the simulated finger off the sensor (emulator-only) — complement to `fingerprint_touch` |
| `has_biometric_enrolled` | Whether any fingerprint is enrolled (+count), from `dumpsys fingerprint` — check before a biometric flow so `fingerprint_touch` has something to match (emulator + physical) |

### Extended Controls (emulator console)
These drive the emulator's Extended Controls panel — a window of the emulator process itself, invisible to `describe_ui`/`tap` — through the emulator console. All emulator-only.
| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `send_sms` | Deliver an incoming SMS (`from`, `text`) — drive OTP / 2FA flows without a second phone |
| `phone_call` | Ring or transition an emulated voice call (`action`: call/accept/cancel/busy/hold) |
| `set_battery` | Set battery `level` (0-100) and/or `charging` state — test low-battery / charging-only UI. Emulator via `emu power`; physical device via `dumpsys battery set` (`reset:true` restores automatic reporting) |
| `rotate_screen` | Rotate the emulator to its next orientation |
| `avd_snapshot` | `save`/`load`/`delete`/`list` AVD snapshots — reset to a known state faster than a cold wipe |
| `cellular` | Shape the radio: `data`/`voice` state, `signal` (0-4), `network_speed`/`network_delay` — offline/roaming/weak-signal/throttled |
| `set_sensor` | Set a hardware sensor (`adb emu sensor set`): `x`/`y`/`z` (accelerometer/gyro/orientation) or `x` only (light/proximity/…) |

### App lifecycle
| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `list_packages` | List installed packages (filterable) |
| `get_app_details` | Version name/code + launchable activity of an app |
| `app_state` | Runtime state: installed?/running? + pid(s), process uptime, install/update times, and Metro-vs-embedded bundle (RN/Expo) — run first when JS edits seem to have no effect, or to catch two live processes for one package |
| `install_app` / `uninstall_app` | Install/reinstall or remove an app |
| `launch_app` / `stop_app` | Launch the LAUNCHER activity (echoes the component; clear error if none) / force-stop |
| `reload_app` | Best-effort Metro/JS reload via the RN `RELOAD_APP_ACTION` broadcast |
| `open_dev_menu` | Open the RN dev menu (`KEYCODE_MENU`) when `reload_app` doesn't apply |
| `last_crash` | Most recent app crash from the DropBox (full header + stack, JVM/RN + native) |
| `clear_app_data` | Wipe data+cache → first-launch state |
| `grant_permission` / `revoke_permission` | Grant/revoke a runtime permission |
| `open_url` | Open a URL or deep link (ACTION_VIEW) |
| `launch_dev_client` | Launch an Expo dev build straight at Metro (`<scheme>://expo-development-client/?url=…`), skipping the Dev Launcher — run `adb_reverse tcp:8081` first |
| `push_file` / `pull_file` | Copy files to/from the device |

### Logs & capture
| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `logcat` | One-shot dump of recent log lines — last N or `since` a time window ("2m", device clock), filterable by substring/`priority`/`tags` — find the native `Caused by:` |
| `clear_logcat` | Empty the ring buffer (`logcat -c`) — clear → act → read isolates what ONE action logged |
| `start_logcat_capture` / `stop_logcat_capture` | Stream logs across a flow, then return them (substring/`priority`/`tags` filters; last 500 lines by default, override with `tail`) |
| `start_screen_record` / `stop_screen_record` | Record the screen to mp4 and pull it |

### Environment & diagnostics
| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `set_dark_mode` | Toggle the system dark theme |
| `set_location` | Set the mock GPS location |
| `set_status_bar` | Pin a clean status bar (SystemUI demo mode) — clock/battery/mobile signal+carrier+data-type/notifications — for tidy screenshots |
| `stay_awake` | Keep the display on for a driving session (`svc power stayon`) — stops a doze-happy emulator blanking screenshots to black mid-flow |
| `doctor` | Report SDK/adb/emulator/AVD/device health |

### Build & test (Gradle)
| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `gradle_build` | `./gradlew assembleDebug` (or a given task) → APK path |
| `build_and_run` | One-shot: `gradle_build` → `install_app` → `launch_app` on a device (installs the newest non-test APK the build produced) |
| `run_unit_tests` | `./gradlew test` → pass/fail/skip summary, per-suite timing, failure stack traces; `json=true` for structured output |
| `run_instrumented_tests` | `./gradlew connectedAndroidTest` (needs a device) → same summary |
| `list_gradle_tasks` | Discover available Gradle tasks |
| `list_gradle_variants` | List buildable build variants (from the `assemble*` tasks) — the "list schemes" analogue; feed a name to `task=` on gradle_build/build_and_run |
| `list_gradle_projects` | List the Gradle modules of a multi-module build (`gradlew projects`) — e.g. `:app`, `:core`, `:feature:login`; point other Gradle tools at the right module or address a task with `:module:task` |

## Resources (the bundled "skill")

The driving know-how ships as MCP resources the client can list and read:

| URI | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `android://guide/getting-started` | Boot & connect, the `serial` argument, a first interaction |
| `android://guide/driving` | The observe→act loop, the true-pixel coordinate rule, tap-eating gotchas |
| `android://guide/pin-and-lock` | Native PIN pads and Keystore-required device locks |
| `android://guide/crash-triage` | Using `logcat` to find why a native call really failed |
