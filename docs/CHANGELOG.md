# Changelog

Shipped work, newest first. Roadmap and open ideas live in
[BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md); the code layout is described in
[../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md).

## v0.10.0 — last_crash, bounded capture, clearer launch_app

Clears the rest of the actionable council-hub field feedback.

- **`last_crash`** (new tool) — returns the most recent app crash from the
  system DropBox (`dumpsys dropbox --print`, JVM/RN and native), full header +
  stack in one call, optionally filtered to a package. Keeps the whole fatal
  together even after it's rotated out of the logcat ring buffer. DropBox
  parsing is pure/unit-tested; live-verified against a real recorded crash.
- **`stop_logcat_capture` output is bounded by default** — capped to the last
  500 lines (override with `tail`), so a long capture stops blowing the token
  budget and force-spilling to a file.
- **`launch_app` gives a clear failure** — a missing/uninstalled package or
  no-launcher-activity now returns a plain error instead of a raw `monkey`
  arg-dump, and on success echoes the resolved component.
- **`logcat` buffer-rotation hint** — an empty one-shot dump now points at
  `start_logcat_capture`/`stop_logcat_capture` or `last_crash` for a fatal that
  already scrolled off.
- **Driving guide** documents the `screenshot`/`describe_ui` state-skew during
  transitions and the black-screenshot → `describe_ui` fallback.

## v0.9.0 — screenshot black-frame detection & diagnosis

From council-hub field feedback: `screenshot` returned a bare black PNG in two
different situations with no hint why, causing repeated misdiagnosis.

- **`screenshot` now detects an all-black frame and says why.** It retries an
  all-black grab a couple of times (screencap intermittently returns black for
  a perfectly normal screen — the reported reliability bug), and if it stays
  black, diagnoses the likely cause: a `FLAG_SECURE` window (e.g. a native PIN
  pad, which the OS blanks to black) or a sleeping display. The result carries
  a compact status (`{all_black, secure_window, screen_off, attempts}`) and
  points the caller at `describe_ui`, which works even when a screenshot is
  blanked. Live-verified: normal screens aren't flagged; a screen-off frame is
  detected and labelled. Black detection (`isMostlyBlack`) is pure/unit-tested;
  the secure-window/screen-off probes are best-effort `dumpsys` reads.

## v0.8.0 — reload_app, open_dev_menu, richer log filtering

From real field feedback (council-hub `android-emulator-mcp-feedback`) on two
long a partner app/Expo dev-client debugging sessions — the two items flagged as
costing the most back-and-forth.

- **`reload_app`** — best-effort Metro/JS reload via the classic React Native
  `<package>.RELOAD_APP_ACTION` broadcast. Live-verified against a real Expo
  dev client (`com.example.devclient`): the broadcast triggered an actual
  reload attempt (it surfaced Metro's "couldn't load script" error, since
  Metro wasn't running in the test — confirming the receiver fired). Not
  guaranteed on newer bridgeless-mode RN architectures that don't register
  the receiver; falls back to `open_dev_menu`.
- **`open_dev_menu`** — opens the RN dev menu via `KEYCODE_MENU`, for driving
  Reload/Debug JS Remotely/etc. by hand (`tap_on_text`/`describe_ui`) when
  `reload_app`'s broadcast doesn't apply.
- **Richer log filtering** — `logcat` and `stop_logcat_capture` gained
  `priority` (V/D/I/W/E/F, keeps that level and more severe) and `tags`
  (case-insensitive, OR'd) filters alongside the existing substring filter,
  cutting down on the 89k–327k-char buffer spills the field feedback
  reported. Shared, unit-tested filtering logic (`LogFilter`) now backs both
  tools.

## v0.7.0 — richer status bar, deeper test-report insight, key-combo presets

- **`set_status_bar` — richer demo controls.** Added `network_type`
  (wifi/mobile/none) with `mobile_level`, `data_type` (lte/4g/5g/...), and
  `carrier` for mobile, plus `notifications_visible`/`notification_icon`.
  The `notification_icon` broadcast is best-effort — an obscure,
  version-dependent SystemUI internal that may silently no-op on some SDK
  images; the network/carrier/data-type controls are well-established demo
  mode commands and are the primary value here.
- **Deeper test-report insight.** `run_unit_tests`/`run_instrumented_tests`
  now report per-suite timing and full failure stack traces (previously only
  the first message line), and accept `json=true` for a structured summary.
  Fixed a related bug along the way: a `<testsuites>` wrapper's child suites
  were being flattened into one combined suite before aggregation, which is
  exactly what made per-suite timing impossible — each child suite now stays
  distinct.
- **`input_key_combo` presets.** Added named shortcuts (`select_all`, `copy`,
  `paste`, `cut`, `undo`, `redo`, `save`, `find`) via `preset=`, so callers
  don't need to know the underlying keycodes.

## v0.6.0 — renamed to adb_mcp

- **Renamed the project from `AndroidEmulatorMCP` to `adb_mcp`.** Google's
  [Android brand guidelines](https://developer.android.com/distribute/marketing-tools/brand-guidelines)
  don't allow "Android" (or anything confusingly similar) to lead a product
  name — it has to read as "X for Android," not "Android X." Go module path,
  all internal imports, the binary (`android-emulator-mcp` → `adb-mcp`), the
  MCP server identifier, `.mcp.json`, and the Makefile all moved together.
- Added a trademark-attribution line and brand-compliant tagline to the README
  ("an MCP server *for* Android," not "an Android MCP server").
- Set the Go module path to its public repo URL (`github.com/iksnerd/adb_mcp`)
  so the server is `go install`-able.

### Bug fixes

- **`open_url` with a package target was broken.** A bare package name was
  appended as a positional argument to `am start`, which `am` parses as the
  intent *data URI* — silently clobbering the `-d <url>` and opening the wrong
  thing. Now passed correctly as `-p <package>`.
- **`boot_emulator` could return the wrong serial.** If the pre-boot device
  listing errored, the "new device" snapshot was empty and any already-attached
  emulator was mistaken for the freshly-booted one. That error is now surfaced
  instead of silently driving the wrong device.
- **`swipe` schema now marks `x2`/`y2` as required** (they always were), so the
  calling model isn't misled into omitting the end point.
- **Test-report parsing no longer drops failing-test names** from a
  `<testsuites>` wrapper that also carries aggregate counts on its root element
  (regression test added).
- **The `logcat` "chatty" filter is now precise** — it only drops chatty dedup
  spam, not any line that merely contains the word "chatty" (an app tag,
  package name, or message).

### Repo / OSS readiness

- Added `LICENSE` (MIT), `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODEOWNERS`, and a
  tag-triggered GitHub Actions release workflow that gates on
  `gofmt`/`vet`/`test`, then cross-compiles binaries and publishes a Release.
- Removed a stale internal planning doc; replaced a private feedback-room
  reference with GitHub Issues; hardened `.gitignore`.

## v0.5.1 — clean process shutdown

- **Fix capture-session leak on client disconnect.** The server shut down via `log.Fatalf`, which `os.Exit`s and skips deferred cleanup — so on the normal stdin-EOF path (the MCP client closing), `StopAllCaptures()` never ran and a live `adb logcat`/`screenrecord` process plus its temp file leaked. Cleanup now runs explicitly on every exit path.
- **Exit cleanly on a normal disconnect.** A cancelled context (SIGINT/SIGTERM) or closed stdin now exits 0 quietly instead of logging a fatal "server error"; only genuinely unexpected errors are fatal (`isCleanShutdown` helper — the go-sdk folds `io.EOF` into a string with no exported sentinel).
- Verified live: the server exits when the client closes or is SIGKILL'd (no orphan), and capture sessions are torn down on both the EOF and signal paths. The `boot_emulator` emulator stays up by design (detached; stop it with `shutdown_emulator`).

## v0.5.0 — architecture split, bug-fix pass, gesture/status/report tools (46 tools)

**Refactor — world-class layout**
- Split the two monolith files (`tools/register.go` 997 lines, `android/device.go` 552 lines) into a domain-mirrored layout: each `tools/<domain>.go` adapter maps to an `android/<domain>.go` execution file, and `register.go` is now just the tool catalog. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) and [architecture.mmd](architecture.mmd).

**Bug fixes (from code review)**
- `screenshot`: `max_dim:0` now actually disables downscaling (was silently remapped to the 760 default, making the documented full-res path unreachable). Arg is `*int`: omit → 760, `0`/negative → full resolution.
- `commandEnv`: match the `PATH` key case-insensitively and preserve its value — the old uppercase-only check appended a duplicate `PATH=` on Windows (case-insensitive keys), clobbering the system path.
- `boot_emulator`: honor the caller's `timeout_s` for the boot-wait phase instead of passing `WaitForBoot` a `<=0` remainder, which it silently treated as its own 120s default.
- `input_text`: single-quote the argument for the device shell so `$`, backtick, quotes, and other metacharacters type literally (the old escaper handled only a subset). Unit-tested.
- Capture sessions: `StopAllCaptures()` drains running logcat/screen-record sessions on shutdown so detached adb processes and temp files don't leak.
- `downscalePNG`: average/store in a consistent premultiplied color space (correctness for translucent PNGs; no change for opaque screenshots).

**New tools**
- `drag` — press-hold-move-release drag (`input draganddrop`, Android 11+), distinct from the fling of `swipe`.
- `input_key_combo` — chorded keys (`input keycombination`, Android 11+), e.g. `["ctrl","a"]`; added modifier + a-z key names.
- `set_status_bar` — SystemUI demo mode for clean doc screenshots (fixed clock, full signal, chosen battery, no notification icons).
- `run_unit_tests` / `run_instrumented_tests` now parse the JUnit XML and report a structured pass/fail/error/skipped summary with the failing tests — on both success and failure.

## v0.4.0 — backlog cleared

- `set_device_lock` optional `old_value` to change an existing lock in one call
- `connect_wireless` (`adb pair`/`connect`) for wireless-adb devices
- `get_app_details` (dumpsys package → version, launchable activity)
- `wait_for_text` (poll describe_ui until a label appears — kills manual sleep+screenshot)
- emulator factory reset — shipped as `boot_emulator {wipe_data:true}` (`-wipe-data`)

## v0.3.0 — XcodeBuildMCP-parity tool batches (40 tools total)

**Batch A — app-lifecycle & interaction completeness**
- `long_press` (input swipe same-point, long duration)
- `uninstall_app` (`adb uninstall`)
- `clear_app_data` (`pm clear`) — reset to clean state
- `grant_permission` / `revoke_permission` (`pm grant`/`revoke`) — skip runtime dialogs
- `open_url` (`am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d`) — deep links
- `push_file` / `pull_file` (`adb push`/`pull`) — test data & artifacts

**Batch B — build & test (true XcodeBuildMCP parity)**
- `gradle_build` (`./gradlew assembleDebug` → APK path)
- `run_unit_tests` (`./gradlew test`)
- `run_instrumented_tests` (`./gradlew connectedAndroidTest`)
- `list_gradle_tasks` (`./gradlew tasks`)

**Batch C — environment & session polish**
- `start_logcat_capture` / `stop_logcat_capture` (streaming session vs one-shot dump)
- `set_dark_mode` (`cmd uimode night yes/no`)
- `set_location` (`emu geo fix <lon> <lat>`)
- `start_screen_record` / `stop_screen_record` (`screenrecord` → mp4 pull)
- `doctor` (check adb/emulator/SDK/AVDs and report)

## v0.2.0 — fixes from live E2E feedback

- `boot_emulator`: launch emulator in its own session (`Setsid`) so it survives the server exit
- `enter_pin`: `grid`/`coords` fallback for canvas-drawn (RN/Skia) pads invisible to uiautomator
- `swipe`: accept `x`/`y` aliases for `x1`/`y1`; clearer missing-arg error
- `describe_ui`: dump-twice-and-settle guard against stale mid-refresh trees
- Guides: RN/Skia limitation + lock-then-restart + Google-Play-image notes
- Install: `rm` + ad-hoc `codesign` in Makefile (fixes macOS "Killed: 9" SIGKILL)
- Versioning: `-version` flag + build-time `-ldflags -X main.version` (git/VERSION)

## v0.1.0 — core driving (21 tools + 4 guide resources)

- Emulator mgmt: `list_avds`, `boot_emulator`, `list_devices`, `wait_for_boot`, `shutdown_emulator`
- Observe: `screenshot` (auto-downscale), `describe_ui` (true-pixel centers)
- Interact: `tap`, `tap_on_text`, `swipe`, `input_text`, `press_key`, `enter_pin`
- Device lock: `set_device_lock`, `clear_device_lock`, `is_device_secure`
- Logs: `logcat`
- App: `list_packages`, `install_app`, `launch_app`, `stop_app`
- Resources: `android://guide/{getting-started,driving,pin-and-lock,crash-triage}`
